# Web interface

Write a web interface in Flask, Django, or something. Also improve command line interface.

# Querying

Query for most recent records only, organized by team. Query only a given team's records for a given service. Probably need to add timestamps to records.

# Persistence

*  Log records to a DB (sqlite?) or something.
*  Maybe load the teams/services data from it too?

# Additional services, Enable/disable

Allow services to be disabled or more services to be added while running.

Alternately simply implement persistence and reload the records.

# Scoring

Assign point values to services and calculate scores.
